## About Me:
I’m finishing a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from [UC Irvine](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/), where my research focuses on your ability to think about what other people may be thinking or feeling, and how that is supported by the structure and function of the brain. We use a mixture of fMRI and eye tracking data to make inferences about what visual features drive the interpretation of others’ actions. 

## Hobbies:
I live about 10 minutes from the beach, but I don’t go surfing that often because I can’t stand how cold the water is. On the flipside, I’m an avid snowboarder. Go figure.
