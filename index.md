## Academics:
I’m finishing a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from [UC Irvine](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/), advised by [Dr. Emily Grossman](https://vpnl.ss.uci.edu/). Our research focuses on your ability to think about what other people may be thinking or feeling, and how that is supported by the structure and function of the brain. We use a mixture of fMRI and eye tracking data to make inferences about what visual features drive the interpretation of others’ actions. 

My undergraduate research at [CSUN](https://w2.csun.edu/social-behavioral-sciences/psychology) under [Dr. Stefanie Drew](https://www.visn-lab.com/) focused on [synesthesia](https://www.britannica.com/science/synesthesia), as well as the possible sources of headaches and eyestrain that people experience after using VR headsets.

## Hobbies:
I like rock climbing, snowboarding, and live music.
